# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data
## Overview of Project
Analysing crowdfunding campaign data to determine possible outcomes could arise based on the deciding factors of starting up a new fundraising project of louice.The projected budget is set to approximately $10,000
The main deciding and analysing factors would be concluded upon success rate of the particular subcategory based on the launch date and goals separately.
As the main objective of the fundraising campaign is to fund for a new play,the final analysis is based on the subcategory play and it outcomes based on the funding goals and parent category theater and it outcomes based on the launch day.   

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to compare and get to know the outcomes of different campaign in relation with campaign launch date and the funding goals of each campaign.The final analysis and conclusion will be main decidind factor of when to , how to and plan the project to be successful. The data will be analysing using the following excel workbook. 

## Analysis and Challenges
As described above the analysis is based mainly based on,
- Analysis of outcomes based on launch date
- Analysis of outcomes based on Goals

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Added a new column to the worksheet as "years " and extracted the year from date created column in order to determine the readable format. 
- Fitered a pivot table based on parent category and years with all the outcomes except live to analyse the each outcomes. 
- Grouped row lables according to the months of the year to analyse the success factor of all categories in each month. 
- Filtered the theater from the parent category to show the success factor in each month and this will be shown in the theater outcomes by launch date sheet in the work book.
- Pivot chart were created sorting the outcomes in descending order. 
- The chart shows as follows and noticing the higher successful rate in May and June.
  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Used the countifs() to visualize percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on funding goal amounts.
- Collected the outcomes and goal data for the subcategory "play " 
- This can be found in the sheet "outcomes based on goals"
- In the goal column created dollar amount as ranges as the projets can be grouped based on their goal amount. 
- Calculated the total projects and percentage of each outcomes to visualize the relationship between the goal amount ranges and the percentage of each outcomes. 
- This following line chart shows the outcome perfectly for the above analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
